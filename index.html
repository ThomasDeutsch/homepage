          <p>One year ago, in January 2019, Chris Coyier released the article <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">The Great Divide</a>.
              It shows that frontend programming is now divided into sub-disciplines and that it leads to an identity crisis.
              I think that the problem we are facing reaches way beyond an identity crisis.
              We are not able to see a systemic problem - a cost that comes with every sub-discipline.
              It is the Voldemort problem - by splitting his soul he had lost his humanity and we are facing the same problem.
              Sub-disciplines are needed, but we dehumanize our workplace if we fail to see the cost: the need for integration!</p>
