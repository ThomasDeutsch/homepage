            <p>One year ago, in January 2019, Chris Coyier released the article <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">The Great Divide</a>.
              He shows that we are facing some challenges by introducing new disciplines and sub-disciplines to the field of software development. 
              What do you need to learn, to call yourself a frontend developer? what even is frontend-development? 
              The difference between "front of the frontend" (UX, UI-Design, a11y) and "back of the frontend" (programming) shows a divide in
              specializations that is not without a cost.
            </p>
            <p>A cost that needs to be addressed in every cross-functional team: with every spezialization comes the need for integration.
              I would argue that this problem ist mostly overlooked and not recognized as one of the biggest problems in modern software development.
            </p>
            <p>In this article, i will define the cost that comes with our specializaions and why we need to address it.
              I will describe a systemic problem at the very core and show a solution to resolve it - something you can use today.
            </p>
            <p>This is all in good spirit, as this article is about improvement and a positive outlook on what is possible. I hope that you will, more often
              then not, find a way to discover that integrated teams can be much bigger than the sum of its parts.

            <h2>A System Of Parts</h2>

            <p>A way to look at our situation, is through the lens of Systems Thinking.</p>

            <p>We are dividing the system of software development into parts (specializations).
                The assumption is, that if we improve every part separately, the system as a whole will improve.
                But this is very misleading.
                A system is a whole, that can not be divided into independent parts.
                The parts are all interconnected. Improving a part will not necessarily improve the system as a whole.
                Most properties of a system will derive from this interconnection - not from the parts taken separatly.
            </p>

            <p class="example">
              <h3>Example</h3>
              When an architect designs a house, he can not design the rooms taken separately.
              The rooms are all interconnected, and if he wants to make the bathroom bigger, he knows that this
              has an impact on other rooms and the structure of the house itself.
              For the best possible house, no room might be the best possible room.
              Everything needs to be evaluated against the improvement of the whole.
              Only with the whole house in mind, the architect is able to make an ovarall improvement.
            </p>

            <p>This is directy reflected in how we develop the software itself.<br>
              We often act and think in silos, and our focus easily shifts from improving the software as a whole to improving specific elements we see as important.
                UI-redesigns and better code abstraction layers - there is always something we can make better.
                At the end of the day it comes down to what we have done with our limited time, money and information.
                If we only improve the parts without the focus on the improvement of the system as a whole, we will not only be wasting
                a lot of opportunities to deliver the best possible result to our customers, we will make the system worse.
            </p>

          <section class="content">
            <h2>A Hidden Cost</h2>
      
            <p>Because all the parts are interconnected, every specialization we introduce will create the need to be integrated into the whole.
            We assume that the right process (for example an agile framework) will bring everything together, but
            the truth is, that a process is limited to coordination. Integration on the other hand, is a common ground. It is an overlap of different disciplines that can result in a shared language and artifact.
            We need a good process, but it is not a substitute for integrative/creative methods.</p>

              <figcaption>Coordination VS Integration</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>Those overlapping areas are the common ground, where we can find ways to work together. 
            Without it  we are only able to throw our work over the fence, for the next person to continue.
            It is a lot like working on an assembly line.
            This is the culture of our economy - the division of labor - a default behaviour we slip into. 
            This is very confinient for your employee.
            As a worker in a process, you are replaceable and your work is more easily measured and it is easy to apply
            more pressure to boost your performance.
            We will find ourselves in a situation where we are not able to take a step back to ask some important questions. 
            You pick the task from the board and you keep working</p>
            
            <p>This is why we need to value integration. This is the Voldemort problem we are responsible for.
            We are dehumanizing our workspace.</p>
            
            <p>I am sure, that everyone would choose to have meaningful conversations and feel engaged to deliver the best possible product.
            We should know that there is a choice - but it requires a bit of change. 
            In my opinion, there is a main reason why we loose the common ground.
            It is the way developers implement scenarios of behaviour - in contrast to the reqirements and testing.
            It seems that there are two worlds that can not be overlapped.</p>
