          <h1>The Need For Integration</h1>
          <h2>to prevent the division of labor in software development</h2>

          <p>One year ago, in January 2019, Chris Coyier released the article <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">The Great Divide</a>.
              It shows that frontend programming is now divided into sub-disciplines and that it leads to an identity crisis.<br>
              I think that the problem we are facing reaches way beyond an identity crisis.
              We are not able to see <b>a systemic problem</b> - a cost that comes with every sub-discipline.
              It is the Voldemort problem - by splitting his soul he had lost his humanity and we are facing the same problem.
              Sub-disciplines are needed, but we <b>dehumanize our workplace</b> if we fail to see the cost: the need for integration!</p>

            <h3>Specializations</h3>
              <p>Specializations in Design and Development with Sub-Specializations like UX and A11Y have grown in the last years and have a big impact on how we work.
                  With all the positive change that specializations bring to every aspect of software development, why should there be a cost?</p>
              <p>Let us look at our situation form a Systems Thinking point of view.</p>
              <p>We are dividing the system of software development into parts.
                  The assumption is, that if we improve every part separately, the system as a whole will improve.
                  But this is misleading.
                  A system is a whole, that can not be divided into independent parts.
                  The parts are all interconnected. Improving a part will not necessarily improve the system as a whole.</p>   
              <p> For Example. 
                When an architect designs a house, he can not design the rooms taken separately.
                The rooms are all interconnected, and if he wants to make the bathroom bigger, he knows that this
                has an impact on other rooms and the structure of the house itself.
                For the best possible house, no room might be the best possible room.
                Everything needs to be evaluated against the improvement of the whole.
              </p> 
              <p>We often act and think in silos, and our focus easily shifts from improving the software as a whole to improving specific elements we see as important.
                  UI-redesigns and better code abstraction layers - there is always something we can make better.
                  At the end of the day it comes down to what we have done with our limited time, money and information.
                  If we can not see the whole picture and evaluate our work by the value we add to the whole, we will be wasting a lot of opportunities to deliver the best possible result.
